  alt: "\"Hey Justin, thank you for giving me your time. My name is (redacted), I am a pretty young guy (23) and I've been working full time as a software developer for almost 4 years. I have always had an entrepreneurial drive in me, as I don't believe in 9-5 being the way to go for me.  My question to you is: How should I deal with competitors? In my niche, the main competitor is a massive organization that has a huge network of contacts in the industry.  I'm a little in over my head. I have never competed with other businesses like this before. If you could shed some light on what you think about my situation then that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. I can't wait to listen to your next podcast!  Kind regards,\""
