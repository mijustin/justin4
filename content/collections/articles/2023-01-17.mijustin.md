            text: 'Governments typically outsource the collection of sales tax to businesses because it is more efficient and cost-effective than having government agencies collect the tax directly. Businesses are already collecting money from customers as part of their sales transactions, so they can simply remit a portion of that money to the government regularly. This approach also puts the burden of compliance on businesses rather than on government agencies. Additionally, businesses have a vested interest in ensuring that the correct amount of tax is collected, as they can face penalties for noncompliance.'
