He started helping with customer support part-time in 2023, but it quickly became apparent that he needed to be a permanent fixture on our team. Having him answer tickets during the day meant that I could focus more on strategy and growth. Plus, he's just better at serving customers than me! We regularly get messages praising his helpful and friendly support."

Sadly, the team members decided that they didn't have the energy and resources to keep pushing the project forward. This is a common reality in the startup world: life happens, priorities shift, and sometimes good products have to be sunset. The founders had other commitments (finances, family) that needed their attention. While it's disappointing when this happens, it's also a natural part of the startup journey. Not every bet works out, but that's why they call it 'betting."
