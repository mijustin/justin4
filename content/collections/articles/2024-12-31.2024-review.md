He started helping with customer support part-time in 2023, but it quickly became apparent that he needed to be a permanent fixture on our team. Having him answer tickets during the day meant that I could focus more on strategy and growth. Plus, he's just better at serving customers than me! We regularly get messages praising his helpful and friendly support."
