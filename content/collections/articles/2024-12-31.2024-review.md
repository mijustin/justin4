However, the good times and milestones feel almost more significant. Being able to look back on a year and remember these moments is a big reason I write these posts every year.'

But I''m also aware that I''m in a transition period. The raw creative energy of my 20s and 30s is evolving into something different â€“ what Arthur Brooks calls "crystallized intelligence." My challenge now is figuring out how to leverage these new strengths effectively.'

He started helping with customer support part-time in 2023, but it quickly became apparent that he needed to be a permanent fixture on our team. Having him answer tickets during the day meant that I could focus more on strategy and growth. Plus, he's just better at serving customers than me! We regularly get messages praising his helpful and friendly support."
