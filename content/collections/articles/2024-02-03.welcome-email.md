          **Subject line:** What brought you here?

          **Body:** Hi,

          I'm really glad you've decided to try our podcast hosting platform! I'm Justin, one of the co-founders.

          I'm curious: what's happening in your world that brought you to Transistor?

          (We're a small company, and it's always helpful to hear why people signed up).

          Also, how did you hear about us?

          Thanks,
          Justin Jackson
