meta_title: '2023 year in review'
meta_description: "Since 2013, I've been sharing my thoughts and reflections in a year-in-review post each year. These aren't just your average summaries; they're a mix of the big wins (and stumbles) in my bootstrapping journey and the personal stories I'm comfortable sharing with you all. It's a blend of business insights and life lessons.\""
