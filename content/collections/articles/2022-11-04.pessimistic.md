          <p>Thanks for sharing. This certainly makes me think. The idea that "pessimism == negativity/unhappiness" has indeed been put into our brains by the media.</p>

          <p>I myself am guilty of accusing my spouse of being overly negative/pessimistic quite often. Maybe I'm being slightly unfair to her. Will have to think more about this.</p>

          <p>I am a long-time reader and first-time responder; this article definitely struck a chord with me.</p>

          <p>Too much of anything (pessimism or optimism) is a problem, and the key is to always find balance in life. My biggest takeaway: things need to be questioned and analyzed. I've always told people that my 6 best friends are who, what, when, where, why, and how.</p>

            <p>I think "concerned optimist" would be the right term. Pessimism points at the doom and argues against any solution.</p>
            <p>Optimism sometimes gets confused with being naive or carefree. I think an optimist is aware of the possible downfall, but employs every resource to overcome, including having above average faith and belief.</p>

          <h4>Martin Boss says:</h4>

          <p>I consider myself an optimist, but that doesn't mean I don't realize things are shit when they are. It's more like "yeah this sucks, but we can (have to, will) make it right".</p>

          <p>I have an immense belief that humans are generally good, and the larger view of history shows we're generally moving in the right direction. Not everywhere, and not always, and not as fast as we could've - but still [in a positive direction].</p>

          <p>Just want to say that I appreciate your thoughtfulness. So many people in tech are, imo, overly optimistic only because their frame of reference is so limited. They only focus on tech and so, if you're only looking at, say, developments in front-end frameworks, then sure, things are getting better. This kind of myopic utopianism is so frustrating. I'm glad that a few people, like you, who work in tech are also able to recognize that things aren't always perfect. And this is especially true when you look outside of the privileged world of tech. So, thanks for being pessimistic. I, for one, appreciate your pessimism.</p>
