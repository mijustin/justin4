At 43, with three kids in high school and one in college, I need something that works on my timeline. I've had success before – doing it again at the same scale doesn't make sense; time matters more now. So, it became logical to find something that better capitalizes on my talents and time. It's bittersweet, but it makes sense.\" – Matt Wensing"
