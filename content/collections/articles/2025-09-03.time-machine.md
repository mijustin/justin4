          I have sometimes heard it called &quot;resulting&quot; or &quot;outcome bias&quot;

          The cognitive bias is that we attribute an outcome to the actions that preceded it, but don&#x27;t account for alternatives that may have provided similar outcomes</p>&mdash; Josh Nussbaum (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4kv2a77kbjmssl4vfrc5ddbx?ref_src=embed">@joshnuss.com</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4kv2a77kbjmssl4vfrc5ddbx/post/3lxxk3d4s6k2i?ref_src=embed">September 3, 2025 at 2:08 PM</a></blockquote>
