        text: "Getting laid off doesn’t just rattle your career; it shakes the very foundation of your life. I've seen friends lose their jobs and go into an existential tailspin. It's not uncommon for them to blame themselves and to feel immense guilt and shame. The experience is especially hard on parents whose families depend on them for income."

Growth took precedence over profitability. Then, capital dried up, and companies started thrashing. Their response was to fire large groups of people in a hasty and unthought-out manner.'
